        <h4>Instructions</h4>
         <ol>
          <li><h5>Prepare the Meat Sauce</h5></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large skillet or pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef and Italian sausage (if using) and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Drain excess fat.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Add sugar, dried basil, and dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low, cover, and let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            </ul>

          <li><h5>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture:</h5></li> 
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan cheese, and parsley. Mix until well combined and set aside.</li>
            </ul>

          <li><h5>Preheat Oven</h5></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F</li>
            </ul>

         <li><h5>Assemble the Lasagna</h5></li>    
            <ul>
                <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom</li>
                <li>Arrange 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle with 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese. Top with 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Repeat these layers (noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce) two more times, finishing with a final layer of noodles, sauce, and mozzarella on top.</li> 
            </ul> 

         <li><h5>Bake the Lasagna</h5></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the dish with foil (to prevent sticking, either use foil that’s nonstick or spray with cooking spray).</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 15-20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            </ul>

         <li><h5>Serve and Enjoy</h5></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil if desired. <em>Serve and enjoy!</em></li>
            </ul>             
            

         </ol>
